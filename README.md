## 📌 Project Overview
- Performed **EDA** with visualizations to uncover insights.  
- Conducted **data cleaning & preprocessing** (handling nulls, duplicates, outliers).  
- Applied **feature engineering techniques**:
  - Encoding categorical variables  
  - Creating new derived features  
  - Normalization & scaling  
- Explored **feature extraction methods** like PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
- Prepared dataset for downstream **ML modeling**.
